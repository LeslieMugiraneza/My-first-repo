Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Leslie Mugiraneza. I am from Rwanda and currently focused on building my skills in software engineering. 
I recently finished high school, and I'm passionate about learning how technology can be used to solve everyday problems and make a difference.

In my free time, I enjoy drawing, listening to music, and reading. 
I’m also part of some community clubs where I’ve taken on leadership roles. 
I’m someone who loves learning, and I aim to gain as many skills as I can—even the ones people least expect. 
I believe that being open to learning different things helps me grow and stay creative.
